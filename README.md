# Sparta JS functions lab

In this folder I created functions in JavaScript and tested them against values e.g. reverse word, percentage increase, basic maths etc.

To find the tests, once the web browser is open, go to the developer console and you can see all the tests pass.

If you don't know how to open developer console, right-click anywhere on the browser and select 'inspect' then click console.
